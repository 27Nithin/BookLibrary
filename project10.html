                    <h3>The episode begins with Ben taking a swim in a lake at night. Gwen isn't as eager to get dirty water all over her. Ben teases her but is suddenly pulled under when she turns away. As Gwen checks back, a giant monster emerges from the lake and scares her. She drops her flashlight, revealing it's actually just Ben pranking her as Four Arms. As Gwen storms off, a tentacle of an actual monster pulls Four Arms under the lake. Four Arms manages to escape and makes it back to the Rust Bucket in a sweat, though Gwen and Max obviously don't believe him and tell him to cut the act.</h3>
