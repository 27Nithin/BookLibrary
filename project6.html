                <h3>Author Shaul Ezer has brought to life the Old Testament chapters of Joshua’s famous conquest of Jericho. When Joshua takes on Moses’s role as leader of the Hebrews after Moses dies, he must prepare for battle to capture Canaan, the Promised Land.
                    At the same time he faces internal conflicts amongst the Hebrews as others question his leadership and his plans. Joshua must persevere in his trust that God will help him conquer the fortified city. This is a story of spies and intrigue, of human frailties and doubts in times of crises and danger, and of a stunning military victory.</h3>
